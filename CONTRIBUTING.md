# Contributing

Workflow Steps

Fork the Repository:
- Fork the original repository on GitHub.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

Create a Feature Branch:
- Checkout dev from your fork.
- Pull the latest changes from the original repository's dev.
- Create a new feature/* branch.

Work on Feature:
- Commit changes regularly.
- Push to the feature/* branch in your fork.

Make a Pull Request:
- Go to the original repository on GitHub.
- Create a PR from your feature/* branch to the original repositoryâ€™s dev branch.

Update your Fork (if needed):
- If changes are made in the original dev branch while your PR is open, pull the latest changes from the original dev into your local dev.
- Merge the updated dev into your feature/* branch, resolve conflicts, and push the changes to update your PR.

Best Practices

- Regularly update dev from the original repository before starting a new feature.
- Keep feature branches focused on a single task.
- Avoid direct commits to dev in your fork.
- Use pull requests to propose changes and facilitate code reviews.

We look forward to your new feature!

## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems.
Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. [**Read the documentation**](https://github.com/tradex-app/CaleX/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) (work in progress)

2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in the TradeX code with a reduced test case that should be included in each bug report.

3. **Include a live example.** Make use of CodeSandbox, jsFiddle, jsBin, or the like  to share your isolated test cases. Also, a screen capture would work, with tools like LICEcap.

4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Pull requests

1. Changes must be done in `/src` files, never just the compiled files. Also, don't commit the compiled files.

2. Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes. Keep them simple and small

3. Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request

4. Write tests for your code, these can be found in `/tests`.
